# Eachine H8 mini 3D firmware

*board warning: some boards use an unsupported cpu. Check the cpu markings for St logo or stm32F031
The unsupported cpu can't be connected to or erased. You can also check for rx and tx pads, present on the unsupported board's bottom side*

### Hardware information
The eachine H8 3D uses a STM32F031 processor with 16K flash, MPU 6052 gyro and XN297 radio.
It also has a 5V step-up onboard, followed by a 2.8V linear reg. Because of this, care should be taken not too overdischarge the battery, as the quad will not reset until the battery will become very low.

For this reason, the firmware currently uses the "#define LVC_PREVENT_RESET" to reduce the throttle when the battery is too low.

Do not change the motor pins as setting them incorrectly will break the board.


### Installation and Support
*Flashing instructions same as the CG023 in the link below*

Currently this port is covered by the CG023 thread on rcgroups.

### Radio protocol:
Stock H8 3d protocol, the rate switch cycles between 2 level modes (high / low rates) and 1 acro ( high rates)

For Deviation Tx / module please use Bayang protocol, as it has better accuracy, and also has more on/off channels.


### Accelerometer calibration:
Move the pitch stick down 3 times within about 2 seconds. Needs to be done on a level surface. Saved so it only needs to be done once. You may need to use high rates in order to reach the treshold. High rates only right now.


### Differences from H8 version:
 * the quadcopter rate ( in deg/sec) is no longer multiplied by 2, so it's the actual rate with devo.
 * acro only version can be compiled by enabling respective setting in config.h

### Motor cut
The board includes a step-up regulator and to prevent battery damage the motors will stop working when a voltage treshhold is reached.

### Linux/gcc version
The gcc version compiles close to 16k, and may need turning off features in order to make it fit. Read install.md for flashing information.

### Board images
Check the boards are identical with the images below

**the JJRC H22 board is not the same!**
